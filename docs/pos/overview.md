# MobilePay Point of Sale

MobilePay PoS is a solution for customers to pay through their mobile via a QR code or the white MobilePay box.

In order to use MobilePay PoS, the checkout system must be online, and the PoS integrator must support MobilePay.

Our MobilePay PoS REST api  is intended for software developers implementing MobilePay payments in a PoS system

The MobilePay PoS API exposes two separate flows for payments which are documented in this section. All payments must be explicitly captured by the client after the customer has approved the payment. The capture amount can be for the full or a partial amount.
