# Getting started

You will be starting off in the Sandbox. Its purpose is to give developers a shielded environment for testing and integration purposes. Sandboxes are isolated from your production organization and give you the possibility to explore the API Platform.

The MobilePay Sandbox is a self-contained, testing environment that mimics the live MobilePay production environment. It provides you the space to play around and test your implementation and the requests you make to the MobilePay API.

## Register

* Please fill out this [registration form](https://mobilepay.dk/erhverv/integrator-signup) to start the technical onboarding.
* Take a look at the API documentation. You'll find it in the [API references menu](/api/pos).

## Receive security credentials

Your technical contact will receive instructions on the technical onboarding. If you have not received this email you can [request security credentials](mailto:developer@mobilepay.dk?subject=Request%20security%20credentials%20MobilePay%20PoS%20sandbox&amp;body=Hi%20Developer%20support%2C%0A%0AWe%20have%20completede%20step%201-3%20and%20wish%20to%20request%20security%20credentials%20for%20organization%3A%0A%0AThe%20password%20for%20the%20zip-file%20can%20be%20sent%20to%20phone%20number%20%28including%20area%20code%29%3A%0A%20%0ABest%20regards"). The credentials will be password protected, and you must supply a mobile phone number (including area code) to which we can send the password. We will then supply you with security credentials so you can start calling the API.

Please check the documentation about [authentication](/docs/pos/authentication).

Once you have received your security credentials you can initaite your test.
