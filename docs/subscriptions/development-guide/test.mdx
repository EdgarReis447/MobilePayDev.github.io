# Test

In this section, you can find information on testing in sandbox, as well as how to get test data. The Sandbox is a special environment designed just for testing, and an application that targets the Sandbox can perform all the operations it can in the Production environment. However, all users, items, and payments involved in Sandbox transactions are fictitious. To ensure a good user experience, we recommend you to test your solution thoroughly before launching.

## Testing API

We supply a testing API, that simulates user actions in the app. With the API you can do the following:

* Accept and reject an agreement
* Cancel agreement
* Reject subscriptions payment
* Accept and reject OneOff payment

You must subscribe to the testing API before you can use it. When calling the testing API, you must always supply an authenticated user id. You can find a list of user ids below in the section about test data. The Subscriptions User Simulation API is available from the Sandbox APIs.

## Sandbox testing

Sandbox testing
You are able to test all the Subscription features, just as they are in the production environment, and you will receive callbacks. You have access to a testing API: Subscriptions User Simulation which makes it possible to imitate user actions. In the [technical documentation](/docs/subscriptions/agreement) you can find flow diagrams, where you can see the app flow.

**Access Token**
When you are calling the API, and when you've been through the OpenID Connect flow, then you should remember to add the access token. All calls to Subscription endpoints require access tokens. The content of the header should look like the following:

 ```json title="Header examples"
 accept: application/json
 content-type: application/json
 authorization::  REPLACE_THIS_VALUE
 ```

When you make a payment request, then we validate the request itself, but not the individual payments. So it only validates if you have the required parameters with the correct types. So the response you get for the payment request does not say if the payment is pending, but if the payment creation is pending. Then the payments are processed in our system, and they will either be requested (valid) or declined (invalid). Moreover, you will receive a callback to inform you whether payments are requested or declined. This will be sent to your payment status callback.

## Test data

When using the Subscriptions User Simulation API, you must always supply an authenticated user id. Below you can find a list of user ids for Denmark and Finland. If there is an issue with a test user, please try a different user, or contact us at developer@vippsmobilepay.com

:::note
When testing Subscription payments and one-offs in Sandbox remember to use the same authenticated user id for both creating and approving the payments.
These are only valid on our test platform, and will not result in a real transaction or transfer of funds.
You can test how your integration handles responses from the MobilePay platform by forcing specific result codes.

Also, familiarize yourself with the steps described in the testing section to find out in which order you should perform these calls. For Subscriptions, we recommend you create an agreement, so you can request a subscription payment on the agreement.

## Making the first calls

Once you have completed the OpenID Connect flow, you are ready to make the first call to our API.  

1. Call `GET /api/merchants/me` which will return you a list of subscription providers for that merchant, with their IDs and basic information which you will need in the other API calls.

:::note
Note: If you are an integrator  managing the solution for a Merchant, this will be your first task when onboarding them to your platform. The Merchant does not know their SubscriptionsProviderId.
:::

```json title="Request body example"
{
  "Id": "5911127561076736",
  "SubscriptionProviders": [
    {
      "SubscriptionProviderId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "Name": "Netflix",
      "HomepageUrl": "http://netflix.com",
      "CustomerServiceEmail": "customerservice@netflix.com",
      "SelfServicePortalUrl": "http://netflix.com/mylogin",
      "FaqUrl": "http://netflix.com/faq",
      "Status": "active",
      "Address": "RÃ¥dhuspladsen 1",
      "ZipCode": "1550",
      "City": "Copenhagen"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. You can then continue by creating your first MobilePay Subscriptions agreement. To create an agreement use `POST /api/providers/{providerId}/agreements`.

Make a `POST` to the endpoint
`https://api.sandbox.mobilepay.dk/subscriptions/api/providers/{providerId}/agreements` (remember to insert your own URLs)

```json title="Request example"
 accept: application/json
 content-type: application/json
 authorization::  REPLACE_THIS_VALUE

{
 "external_id":"OrderNumber1",
 "amount":10,
 "currency":"DKK",
 "description":"Home and Car Insurance",
 "next_payment_date":"2021-12-16",
 "frequency":12,
 "links":[
   {"rel":"user-redirect","href":"https://example.com/"},
   {"rel":"success-callback","href":"https://example.com/"},
   {"rel":"cancel-callback","href":"https://example.com/"}],
 "country_code":"DK",
 "plan":"Insurance",
 "expiration_timeout_minutes":5,
 "mobile_phone_number": "4511100118",
 "retention_period_hours": 0,
 "disable_notification_management": false,
}
```

If successful, you will receive a http `201 created` response including an agreement id for the pending agreement, and a link to redirect the user to the pending agreement.
In the sandbox, the link will not be working, instead, you need to use the Subscriptions User Simulation API and the test data we have provided you with, to accept the agreement. Use `PATCH /api/agreements/v1/{id}` to accept the agreement.
Congratulation, you have created your first agreement!

## Testing example - Accept Agreement - 3rd party

When you have created an agreement in the sandbox, you can use the testing API to simulate that a user accepts the agreement.
To accept an agreement you must use `PATCH /api/agreements/v1/{id}` and replace `{id}` with an agreement id.

**Example**
Make a `PATCH` to the endpoint
`https://api.sandbox.mobilepay.dk/recurringpayments-restapi/api/agreements/v1/REPLACE_ID` with the following headers:

 ```json title="Request example"
 accept: application/json
 content-type: application/json
 authenticateduser: REPLACE_THIS_KEY

{"status":"Accepted"}
```

If successful, you will receive a http `204 No Content` response. We will then send a callback to the success-callback you set, when the agreement was created, to inform you that the agreement has been accepted:

 ```json title="Callback body example"
{
    "agreement_id" : "AGREEMENT_ID",
    "status" : "Accepted",
    "status_text" : "The agreement has been accepted.",
    "status_code" : 0,
    "external_id" : "EXTERNAL_ID",
    "timestamp" : "2016-08-24T11:42:27+00:00"
}
```

And then you are ready to start requesting payments for the new agreement.
