# MobilePay Subscriptions

:::caution Change of Subscriptions API 

Please notice that as part of the merger between MobilePay and Norwegian Vipps, we will consolidate products on one joint platform. After we have switched to One platform, you can transition to Vipps MobilePay Recurring API using the [Subscriptions to Recurring migration guide](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/mp-migration-guide/subscriptions/) Familiarize yourself with what migration entails, so you are prepared for the migration process.



:::


MobilePay Subscriptions is a solution for recurring billing of your customers. Implement our Subscriptions API to take advantage of MobilePay Subscriptions. Bill your customers with one-off  invoices or automatically on a recurring basis.

Simplicity is key when opening the door to new subscribers, and MobilePay is synonymous with simple solutions and seamless transactions. Whether it's an agreement with one initial payment or billing on a recurring basis, it only takes a single swipe on their phone for customers to commit â€“ and to stay committed.
