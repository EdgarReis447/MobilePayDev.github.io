# Transition to One Platform

**Our journey to create the ultimate payment wallet in the Nordics**

On November 1st, 2022, we received the exciting news that the merger between MobilePay and Vipps was officially approved! This is a significant milestone for us, and we're thrilled to embark on the journey of creating the ultimate payment wallet experience for our wonderful customers, partners, and users in the Nordics. By early 2024, we're aiming to launch a single, unified app: MobilePay in Denmark and Finland, and Vipps in Norway.

:::info No Need to Reintegrate
There is no need to reintegrate into the new solution. Your existing App Payments integration will continue to work and while our primary goal is to provide an effortless transition, we want to inform you that some functionality will be changing or closed starting from the moment we transition to One Platform. To ensure a smooth experience, we recommend reviewing the upcoming changes outlined below and considering updating your integration accordingly. 
Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the upcoming changes and how they may impact your integration. If you have any questions you are always welcome to reach out to us at developer@mobilepay.dk
