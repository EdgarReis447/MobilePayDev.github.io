# Overview

The Payments API lets developers process payments. Applications can call Payments API to charge MobilePay users. In addition, the Refunds API enables merchants to refund payments. MobilePay processes the refund and returns the payment to MobilePay user's bank account. The Payments API and Refunds API collectively offer an integrated payment experience.
