# MobilePay Invoice

Our MobilePay Invoice API enables you to send Invoice directly into the MobilePay app or use MobilePay as a payment method in an existing Invoice flow (self serve environments or emails)

We have built best practices for Invoice into our defaultsâ€”while still giving you full control and flexibility.

please notice that as a part of the merger between MobilePay and Norwegian Vipps, we will consolidate products one one joint platform. 

In the beginning of 2024 we will therefor replace the current Invoice API with a new and scalable version. We will update this page as soon as the docs for the new API is available.
