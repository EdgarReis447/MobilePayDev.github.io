* Take a look at the API documentation. You'll find it [here](/api/reporting)

## Authenticate to the API

We are providing two different options for authentification. 
- [API keys](#api-keys): This is a simple solution aimed at merchants integrating on their own behalf. They are used to get unlimited access to resources in your merchant account. These are retrieved through or MObilePay Portal.
- [OAuth](#oauth-access-token): This is aimed at larger merchants or integrators integrating on behalf of one or more merchants. It is used to get authenticated and scoped access to any MobilePay merchant account. Use them when your application will access resources on behalf of multiple MobilePay merchant accounts, i.e. you are an integrator. 

## Production

The reporting API consists of only GET endpoints where you can retrieve transaction and transfer details. Therefore we do not require any sandbox test or verification in order to use this product in production.
