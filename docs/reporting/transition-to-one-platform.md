# ðŸ§¡ðŸ’™ Transition to One Platform 

**One Platform â€“ More Reach**

On November 1st, 2022, the merger between MobilePay and Norwegian Vipps was approved. We are now fully committed to transitioning towards a unified platform to become the premier and most widely used payment wallet in the Nordics, for both our valued customers and partners. By early 2024, our ambition is to have a single app, branded as MobilePay in Denmark and Finland, and as Vipps in Norway. Our goal is to unite under one platform, serving more than 11 million users and over 400,000 merchants across the Nordics.

## Shift to Report API  

We will need to replace the current MobilePay Reporting with the [Report API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/report-api/). This transition will require a new integration.

We will consistently provide updates and information to you all regarding the new integration. For information, refer to [Report API]( https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/report-api/).   

For technical changes related to the Report API integration, please visit the [Report API migration guide](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-developers/mp-migration-guide/#point-of-sale-vs-epayment). We will promptly update these pages with additional information as soon as we have more details.
