# Introduction

MobilePay provides APIs that work together to enable you to collect and manage payments.

For information about the product and details on getting started, testing and certification please visit our [Developer Portal](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/products/)

This document does not include a detailed specification of the endpoints, responses, and response codes. This information can be found in the [APIs](https://developer.mobilepay.dk/product/) section of the Developer Portal.

Documentation found here will cover a new set of MobilePay APIs (Payments API, Payment Points API, Refunds API and Webhooks API) which will replace the current AppSwitch solution. There is a step-by-step guide in _Guides_ section which will help you with implementation.

If there are problems with documentation or you need assistance - feel free to contact our [developer support](mailto:developer@mobilepay.dk) or [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/MobilePayDev/MobilePay-Payments-API/issues).
