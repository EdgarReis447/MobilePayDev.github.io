# Frequently asked questions

## What are the MobilePay IP addresses?

Note that MobilePay does not require merchants to whitelist specific IP addresses to access REST APIs.
We utilize different ranges for the APIs and callbacks as well as for the different environments. We cannot supply specific IPs because we may change IPs within the listed ranges and therefore recommend to whitelist the entire range.

**API requests**<br />
Production: 20.238.5.64/28 and 4.245.40.224/28<br />
Sandbox: 4.175.250.192/28

**Callbacks** <br />
Production and sandbox:
212.93.32.0/19 and 185.218.228.0/22 

:::danger Important info
We are in the process of consolidating our platform with Vipps to create a new shared platform. For the products that are using facades ([Subscriptions](/subscriptions/transition-to-one-platform), [App Payments](/app-payments/transition-to-one-platform) and [Online(/online/transition-to-one-platform)]) please note that we will use new servers for all callbacks. Therefore you must adhere to our new [server guidesline](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/developer-resources/servers/).
