# Frequently asked questions

## What are the MobilePay IP addresses?

:::danger Important info
We are currently in the process of changing our IPs for both API and callbacks. This is status of the change:
- API 
  - Sandbox: changed ✔
  - Production: changed ✔
- Callbacks 
  - Sandbox: changed ✔
  - Production: changed ✔
:::
Note that MobilePay does not require merchants to whitelist specific IP addresses to access REST APIs.
We utuiize different ranges for the APIs and callbacks as well as for the different environments. We cannot supply specific IPs because we may change IPs within the listed ranges and therefore recommend to whitelist the entire range.
