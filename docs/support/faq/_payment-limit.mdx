The behavior of the API when you are in sandbox mode is the same as when your app is live, but comes with the following restrictions. The users in the Sandbox have a daily limit at 3.000 DK. It is recommended to send Payment Requests below 10 DKK or 2 EUR. Be sure to test with reasonable amounts and only run a limited number of transactions.
