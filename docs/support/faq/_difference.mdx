Sandboxes are isolated from your production organisation, so operations that you perform in the MobilePay sandbox donâ€™t affect your production organisation. The production version of the API provides access to the real customer data, i.e. you will be able to initiate real payments. Once you go to test in production, you will use another basepath, the live MobilePay app and a real MobilePay user.
