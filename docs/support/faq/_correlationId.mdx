CorrelationId is a unique identifier value that is set as header for each API request
```
header 'correlationid: REPLACE_THIS_VALUE'
```

The id serves as reference for the particular API request and makes API support more efficient. If you are having issue with an API request, please include the correlationId. We recommend to use a random GUID as the correlationId.
