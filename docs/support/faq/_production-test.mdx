Once you have finished testing in sandbox and the verification, you can verify that the set-up is also working in production. This is especially important with regards to using the right redirect URI's in production, and using the right credentials for OpenID Connect in production. You need to update all URLs and credentials to production values. 

Once you've done so, there are two possibilities, and you can choose the option, that fits you the best. 

**Test with your own customer**

You can use one of your existing customers as pilot merchant. In order to do so they need to have an active MobilePay agreement and chosen the decired MobilePay product. 

**Test with your own account**

If you do not want to test with your customer, you have the possibility to order the API product yourself, so you have a registration in production. In this case, you'll be marked as an integrator, and will only pay for the transactions, and not the monthly fee.
